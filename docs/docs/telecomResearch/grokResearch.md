# 1. Industry Standard KPIs (Telecom Sector)

Based on comprehensive research across telecom industry sources, I've identified 15 key performance indicators (KPIs) that are widely used in mobile, broadband, ISP, and carrier networks. These KPIs are derived from standard metrics tracked by telecom operators to monitor business health, network reliability, customer satisfaction, and financial performance. I've grouped them into logical categories for clarity: Revenue Metrics, Customer Metrics, Network Performance Metrics, and Operational Metrics.

Each KPI includes:
- **Name**: The standard name.
- **Definition**: A clear explanation.
- **Why it matters**: Business value and impact.
- **Typical calculation**: Formula with key fields (assuming access to data like customer records, usage logs, revenue streams, and network logs).
- **Level**: Granularity (e.g., customer-level, service-level, region, global).
- **Time grain**: Common aggregation period (e.g., daily, monthly).

### Revenue Metrics
These focus on financial performance and monetization.

| Name | Definition | Why it matters | Typical calculation | Level | Time grain |
|------|------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|------------|
| Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) | The average revenue generated from each user or subscriber over a period. | Tracks revenue efficiency and pricing strategy effectiveness; helps identify upsell opportunities and market saturation. | Total revenue / Average number of active users (key fields: revenue from subscriptions, usage fees; active subscriber count). | Global, regional, or service-level (e.g., mobile vs. broadband). | Monthly or quarterly.

# 2. Snowflake Marketplace Search

Research on the Snowflake Marketplace reveals limited publicly listed telecom-specific datasets as of July 2025. The Marketplace emphasizes secure data sharing and industry solutions like the Telecom Data Cloud, which enables telecom providers to share anonymized data (e.g., network metrics, subscriber trends) without direct listings of ready-to-use datasets. Prioritized areas like call detail records (CDRs), customer churn, ARPU, 5G rollout, and broadband speeds are supported through the Telecom Data Cloud ecosystem, but specific datasets often require partnerships or custom sharing. Many providers offer demo access via Snowflake trials.

Here are the most relevant findings (based on Snowflake's Telecom Data Cloud and associated providers):

These datasets are global or telecom-focused where possible and can support attractive KPIs like churn prediction and network optimization.

# 4. Sample Schema Design

Based on the researched KPIs and datasets (e.g., customer churn, network logs, usage metrics), I suggest a simple star schema for housing telco KPI inputs in Snowflake. This design is scalable, supports joins for calculations, and aligns with telecom data patterns. It uses fact tables for metrics and dimension tables for context. Assume Snowflake's columnar storage for efficiency.

### Key Tables and Columns
- **Customers (Dimension Table)**: Stores subscriber details.
  - Columns: customer_id (PK, string), name, age, gender, join_date, churn_date, region_id, plan_id.
  
- **Plans (Dimension Table)**: Service plan details.
  - Columns: plan_id (PK, string), plan_name, monthly_fee, data_allowance, voice_minutes, contract_length.
  
- **Usage_Metrics (Fact Table)**: Daily/granular usage data for KPIs like ARPU, Data Usage.
  - Columns: usage_id (PK, string), customer_id (FK), date, data_used_mb, voice_minutes_used, revenue_generated, churn_flag.
  
- **Call_Records (Fact Table)**: Call detail records (CDRs) for voice/network KPIs.
  - Columns: call_id (PK, string), customer_id (FK), call_start_time, call_duration, drop_reason, call_type (voice/data), location_id.
  
- **Network_Events (Fact Table)**: Network performance logs for KPIs like Latency, Uptime.
  - Columns: event_id (PK, string), timestamp, region_id (FK), latency_ms, throughput_mbps, uptime_percentage, event_type (e.g., outage, peak).

### Likely Relationships and Join Keys
- Star schema centered on fact tables (Usage_Metrics, Call_Records, Network_Events) joining to dimensions.
  - **customer_id**: Joins Customers to Usage_Metrics and Call_Records (one-to-many; enables customer-level aggregations for Churn Rate, ARPU).
  - **plan_id**: Joins Plans to Customers (many-to-one; for revenue calculations based on plan types).
  - **region_id**: Joins a potential Regions dimension (not detailed here: region_id, country, population) to Customers and Network_Events (for regional KPIs like Subscriber Growth).
  - **date/timestamp**: Time-based joins or partitioning for time-grain aggregations (e.g., monthly ARPU via GROUP BY month).
  
This schema supports queries like: SELECT AVG(revenue_generated) FROM Usage_Metrics JOIN Customers ON ... GROUP BY month (for ARPU). It's flexible for ingestion from public datasets (e.g., map FCC broadband to Network_Events) and can be expanded with views for KPI computations.
