Industry-Standard Telecom KPIs

To deliver a plug-and-play telecom KPI dashboard, we first identify key metrics that telecom companies (mobile, broadband, ISP, carrier networks) universally track. Below we list 15 essential KPIs, grouped by logical category, with definitions, business rationale, typical calculations, level of analysis, and time granularity.

Customer Experience & Retention
	•	Customer Churn Rate – Definition: The percentage of customers who discontinue service in a given period ￼ ￼. Why it matters: Churn directly impacts growth; a high churn indicates dissatisfaction or competitive pressure and forces costly customer acquisition to replace losses ￼. Calculation: (Number of customers lost in period ÷ Number of customers at start of period) × 100% ￼ ￼. Level: Usually company-wide or segmented by product/region; can also be at customer cohort level. Time Grain: Often measured monthly or annually (e.g. monthly churn rate, with 5–7% annual churn considered normal) ￼.
	•	Net Promoter Score (NPS) – Definition: An index from -100 to +100 measuring customer loyalty by asking “How likely are you to recommend us?” on a 0–10 scale ￼. Promoters (9–10) minus detractors (0–6) gives the NPS ￼ ￼. Why it matters: NPS gauges overall brand sentiment and loyalty; higher NPS correlates with word-of-mouth growth and lower churn. Telecom NPS tends to be lower than other industries, so improving it can be a competitive differentiator ￼. Calculation: NPS = % Promoters – % Detractors (from customer survey responses) ￼. Level: Typically a company-wide metric (can be broken down by region or segment). Time Grain: Periodic (e.g. quarterly surveys or rolling 6-month); often tracked over time rather than daily.
	•	Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) – Definition: Average satisfaction score from customer surveys, often asking customers to rate service on a scale (e.g. 1–5 or 1–10) ￼ ￼. Why it matters: CSAT reflects immediate customer approval of services or interactions. Low CSAT highlights pain points (e.g. poor support or network issues) that need attention to prevent churn ￼. Calculation: Usually the percentage of respondents who rated satisfaction above a threshold, or the mean score. For example, CSAT (%) = (Number of satisfied responses ÷ Total responses) × 100% ￼. Level: Can be measured per customer service interaction, per product, or overall. Time Grain: Ongoing – can be averaged monthly or quarterly, and tracked by channel (call center vs. online, etc.).
	•	Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) – Definition: The average revenue generated per customer (subscriber) in a given period ￼ ￼. Why it matters: ARPU is a core financial KPI indicating how much value each user brings; it reflects pricing strategy and service usage. Higher ARPU signals effective monetization and bundling, while a flat or declining ARPU may prompt new offerings or upsells ￼ ￼. Calculation: ARPU = Total revenue in period ÷ Average number of users in period ￼ ￼ (often computed monthly or quarterly). Level: Typically overall or by business unit (e.g. mobile postpaid ARPU, broadband ARPU). Can also be segmented by customer type (consumer vs business). Time Grain: Commonly reported per month (e.g. monthly ARPU) but tracked quarterly/yearly in financial reports.
	•	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – Definition: A projection of the total revenue a customer will generate over their tenure. Why it matters: CLV helps prioritize retention efforts and marketing spend – high-CLV customers are worth investing in to retain. It ties together ARPU, churn, and margins. Calculation: Often modeled as CLV = ARPU × average customer lifespan (months) × profit margin (simplified). Level: Customer-level (can be averaged for segments). Time Grain: Not an observational time series metric; it’s a cumulative or modeled value updated periodically.
	•	Subscriber Growth / Net Additions – Definition: The net change in subscriber count over a period, i.e. gross new customer adds minus customers who left (disconnects) ￼. Why it matters: Indicates the company’s market momentum. Consistent growth in subscribers fuels revenue; slowing growth or net losses may signal saturation or competitive issues ￼. Calculation: Net adds = New subscribers in period – Subscribers lost in period. Sometimes expressed as a percentage growth rate (net adds ÷ starting subscribers × 100). Level: Company-wide or segmented (net adds by service type or region). Time Grain: Typically monthly or quarterly (telecoms report net adds each quarter in earnings).

Network Performance & Quality
	•	Network Availability (Uptime) – Definition: The percent of time the network is operational and accessible to users ￼. Essentially measures reliability. Why it matters: High availability means fewer outages, directly translating to better customer experience and meeting service level agreements. Downtime can cause customer frustration and revenue loss. Calculation: Network Availability = (Actual operational time ÷ Total scheduled time) × 100% ￼ ￼. For example, if the network is up 23.9 hours in a 24h day, availability = 99.6%. Level: Can be measured at network-wide level or by region or network segment (e.g. core network vs. access network). Sometimes broken out by service (voice vs data availability). Time Grain: Commonly tracked daily or monthly; often reported as a monthly average % uptime.
	•	Dropped Call Rate – Definition: The percentage of voice calls that are unintentionally terminated by the network before either party ends the call ￼ ￼. This is a key call quality metric. Why it matters: A high drop call rate indicates radio coverage or capacity problems that frustrate users, leading to dissatisfaction and churn ￼. Keeping dropped calls low is critical for customer experience and regulatory QoS targets. Calculation: Dropped Call Rate = (Number of dropped calls ÷ Total calls attempted) × 100% ￼. Level: Measured network-wide or per region/cell site; sometimes specific to mobile voice service. Time Grain: Typically monitored daily; aggregated into monthly stats. Real-time monitoring is also common for operations.
	•	Network Coverage – Definition: The geographic area or population covered by the network’s signal at an acceptable service level ￼. Coverage can be expressed as a percentage of population or area with service. Why it matters: Coverage indicates market reach. Gaps in coverage mean missed revenue and customer complaints. Broad coverage (especially 4G/5G) is a competitive selling point and often a regulatory goal ￼. Calculation: E.g. Population Coverage = (Population in network coverage ÷ Total population) × 100%, or similarly by area ￼. Separate values may be given for different technologies (e.g. “5G coverage: 75% of population”). Level: Typically a national or regional metric. Can also be mapped at a granular level (e.g. % of rural areas covered). Time Grain: Changes with network rollouts – reported quarterly or annually as networks expand (not a daily fluctuating metric).
	•	Bandwidth Utilization – Definition: The percentage of available network bandwidth currently being used to carry traffic ￼. This reflects how busy the network is relative to its capacity. Why it matters: Indicates capacity strain; consistently high utilization might forewarn congestion and need for upgrades, while low utilization might indicate over-provisioning ￼. The goal is to optimize usage without exceeding capacity. Calculation: Bandwidth Utilization = (Current data throughput ÷ Total available bandwidth) × 100% ￼. Often measured on specific links or segments (e.g. a backhaul link usage). Level: Network segment level (e.g. per cell site, per backbone link). It can be aggregated to an average utilization for the network or key routes. Time Grain: Continuous monitoring (minutely/hourly), with busy-hour or daily peak utilization often reported.
	•	Average Data Throughput (Speed) – Definition: The average data download/upload speed experienced by users on the network (e.g. in Mbps). Often measured per user or per cell site as user average throughput ￼. Why it matters: Throughput is a direct indicator of user experience for data services. Higher average speeds mean the network can support HD streaming, fast downloads, etc., which drives customer satisfaction. It’s also a marketing point (e.g. “Our average 5G download speed is X Mbps”). Calculation: Typically computed from network data or speed tests: Average throughput = Total data transferred ÷ active data connection time (yielding an average speed). Crowdsourced speedtest data (e.g. Ookla Speedtest) are also used to benchmark this. Level: Can be reported at network level (average speed across all users) and broken down by technology (4G vs 5G) or region/city. Time Grain: Often reported monthly or quarterly in reports; engineering teams monitor it in real-time or daily.
	•	Network Latency – Definition: The time it takes for data to travel from a source to destination across the network, typically measured as round-trip time in milliseconds. Why it matters: Low latency is crucial for real-time applications (VoIP, gaming, etc.). It affects customer experience (lag or delay). In 5G and modern applications (IoT, AR/VR), latency is a key quality metric. Calculation: Measured via pings or network probes (e.g. average ping time). Sometimes reported as average latency or % of packets meeting a latency threshold. Level: Can be measured network-wide or on specific routes. Often segmented by service or application (e.g. latency to a content server). Time Grain: Continuously measured; reported as daily/monthly averages or 95th percentile.
	•	Packet Loss Rate – Definition: The percentage of data packets that are lost in transmission and never reach their destination ￼ ￼. Why it matters: High packet loss degrades voice/video quality and slows data throughput (requiring retransmissions). It indicates network issues like congestion or poor signal quality. Minimizing packet loss is important for network reliability and customer experience ￼. Calculation: Packet Loss Rate = (Number of lost packets ÷ Number of packets sent) × 100% ￼. Level: Often measured on specific links or service types (e.g. packet loss on the core network, or on the radio access network). Time Grain: Continuously monitored; summarized daily or monthly for reporting (e.g. monthly average packet loss %).

Revenue & Financial
	•	Total Revenue & Growth – Definition: The total operating revenue from telecom services (and devices) and its growth rate. Why it matters: Absolute revenue and year-over-year growth indicate the company’s market performance and are top-level indicators of success. Telecoms break revenue into segments (wireless, fixed, broadband, etc.) to see which areas drive growth ￼. Calculation: Sum of all service and product revenue. Growth = (Current period rev – Prior period rev) ÷ Prior period rev × 100%. Level: Company-wide, and by business unit or geography. Time Grain: Tracked quarterly and annually (financial reporting cycles). Often shown as YoY % growth.
	•	Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA) – Definition: Similar to ARPU but per account (which may include multiple users or lines under one billing account). Why it matters: Many telecom customers are on family or enterprise plans. ARPA captures the value of an account with possibly multiple subscriptions. It’s useful for measuring revenue in contexts where accounts have multiple lines. Calculation: ARPA = Total revenue ÷ Total number of accounts (in a given period). Level: Company or segment level. Time Grain: Monthly/quarterly.
	•	EBITDA Margin – Definition: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization as a percentage of revenue. It’s a profitability KPI widely tracked in telecom. Why it matters: Telecom is capital-intensive; EBITDA margin indicates operational profitability by stripping out non-cash depreciation and one-time items. Investors watch it closely ￼. Calculation: EBITDA Margin = (EBITDA ÷ Total Revenue) × 100%. Level: Company-wide (financial metric). Time Grain: Quarterly/annual.
	•	Capital Expenditure (Capex) to Sales Ratio – Definition: The percentage of revenue reinvested in capital expenditures (network upgrades, spectrum, infrastructure). Why it matters: Indicates how aggressively a telco is investing in its network relative to its income. High Capex/Sales may mean heavy network investment (e.g. 5G rollout) which can impact free cash flow ￼. Calculation: Capex to Sales = (Capital expenditures ÷ Total revenue) × 100%. Level: Company-wide. Time Grain: Annual or quarterly (often annual in reports).
	•	Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – Definition: The average cost to acquire a new customer (marketing, promotions, device subsidies, etc.). Why it matters: Lowering CAC improves profitability per user. In a saturated market, high CAC can erode the value of net adds. Calculation: CAC = Sales/marketing expenses for new adds ÷ Number of new customers acquired (in a period). Level: Company-wide or by segment (prepaid vs postpaid often have different CAC). Time Grain: Quarterly/annual.

(Note: Many other KPIs exist, but the above are among the most universally tracked. These KPIs fall into categories like customer experience (NPS, CSAT, churn), network performance (availability, drop rate, speed), and financial health (ARPU, revenue, margins) ￼ ￼. They provide a balanced view of a telco’s operational and business performance.)

2. Telecom Data Sources on Snowflake Marketplace

To power a telecom KPI dashboard, we can leverage third-party data from the Snowflake Marketplace. Several providers offer telecom-related datasets that can enrich analyses (call detail records, network quality metrics, subscriber demographics, etc.) or serve as sample data for a demo. Here are a few notable datasets and providers:
	•	Point Topic – Global Broadband Statistics (Provider: Point Topic / Expert Intelligence): A dataset offering broadband availability and speed statistics across regions (especially strong for Europe and global benchmarks). Use Case: Benchmarking broadband penetration and speeds by country or region, identifying underserved markets. Key Fields: Country/Region, number of broadband subscribers, broadband technologies (DSL, fiber, cable) and their coverage, average download/upload speeds. (Available via Snowflake Marketplace as part of Expert Intelligence’s offerings ￼ ￼.)
	•	Ookla Speedtest Intelligence (Provider: Ookla): Crowdsourced network performance data with granular download speed, upload speed, and latency measurements worldwide. Use Case: Analyze mobile vs. fixed broadband speeds by location, compare network quality between carriers, track improvements in 5G rollout (e.g. seeing average 5G speeds climb as network matures). Key Fields: Geolocation (tile or census area), timestamp, avg download Mbps, avg upload Mbps, latency (ms). Often aggregated by month and geography for easy analysis. (Ookla’s data is used industry-wide for speed benchmarking; it can be accessed via their Snowflake data share or AWS Open Data ￼ ￼.)
	•	TransUnion Demographic & Credit Data (Provider: TransUnion): A rich consumer demographic dataset (income, family size, credit score bands, etc.) that telecoms use to enrich customer profiles. Use Case: Enhance churn and ARPU models by adding customer attributes – e.g. linking credit scores to payment risks, or household size to upsell opportunities. Also useful for targeted marketing (identify high-value customer segments). Key Fields: Anonymized customer ID or geography, age range, income range, credit risk score, household composition, etc. (TransUnion provides data via Snowflake Marketplace; for telecom, this falls under “demographic data” enabled through Snowflake’s secure data sharing ￼.)
	•	OneWeb Satellite Coverage Data (Provider: OneWeb): Dataset from OneWeb (a satellite internet operator) with information on satellite broadband coverage and performance. Use Case: Augment terrestrial network data – e.g., identify areas with satellite coverage (to partner for rural coverage) or analyze performance of satellite vs terrestrial broadband. Could also assist in network planning (knowing where satellite backhaul is available). Key Fields: Geographic cells (lat/long or hex grid), satellite signal availability, down/up throughput observed, outage events. (OneWeb is an early Snowflake Marketplace partner providing live satellite and geospatial data ￼.)
	•	Carto Location Data (Geospatial) (Provider: Carto): A suite of geospatial datasets such as population density grids, mobility patterns, or points-of-interest. Use Case: Spatial analysis for telecom – e.g., overlay network infrastructure on population density to find where to expand next, use mobility data to see daytime vs nighttime population (to optimize cell placement), or incorporate points-of-interest for planning 5G small cells (stadiums, malls). Key Fields: Varies by dataset – could include location coordinates, population counts, mobility indexes, etc. (Carto is a Snowflake partner providing geospatial data; telecoms can leverage these to enrich their internal data for location-based insights ￼ ￼.)
	•	Amdocs “Networks & Services” Data Samples (Provider: Amdocs): As part of Snowflake’s Telecom Data Cloud ecosystem, Amdocs (a major telecom software vendor) has applications and data models that include sample telecom data (e.g. synthetic call detail records or billing records). Use Case: Quick-start for analytics or AI – e.g., use sample CDR data to demonstrate call drop analysis or use synthetic billing data to compute ARPU if a telco’s own data isn’t connected yet. Key Fields: Depending on dataset – could include Call Detail Records (caller ID, callee, timestamp, duration, tower location, drop flag) or Billing records (account ID, charges, payments). (Amdocs launched pre-built solutions on Snowflake to assist telecoms with charging, billing, and 5G monetization ￼, though their Marketplace offering is more an application than raw data. For a hackathon MVP, Amdocs sample data or model telecom datasets can be used to simulate a telco’s data.)

Note: Snowflake’s Telecom Data Cloud launch highlighted that many data providers are available to telecom companies via Marketplace – including Flywheel/GrowthLoop (customer segmentation and marketing data) and others for “satellite, geospatial, or demographic data” ￼. Additionally, Snowflake itself hosts some public datasets (e.g. census data) that can be joined with telecom data for deeper insights. When choosing data for a hackathon MVP, prioritize those with free trials or sample access (Point Topic offers some open data, Ookla has public speed test data, Kaggle datasets can be loaded into Snowflake, etc.). This ensures you can prototype without heavy costs or licensing hurdles.

3. Public Telecom Datasets (Open Source Alternatives)

If suitable Snowflake Marketplace data is limited, there are numerous free and open datasets in the telecom domain that can be utilized. Here we recommend some public backup datasets and their details:
	•	FCC National Broadband Map Data (USA) – Source: U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). What it is: A detailed database of broadband availability in the U.S., down to individual serviceable locations. It reports which providers and technologies serve each location and the maximum advertised speeds ￼ ￼. Use Case: Analyze broadband coverage gaps (e.g. how many locations lack 100 Mbps service), correlate network investment with coverage, or identify regions for expansion. Key Fields: Broadband Serviceable Location ID, latitude/longitude, provider name, technology (fiber, cable, DSL, wireless), max download speed, max upload speed, and flags for residential/business service ￼ ￼. This data is publicly downloadable (by state/technology) on the FCC site and is updated biannually, enabling rich mapping and availability KPIs.
	•	Telco Customer Churn Dataset (IBM Sample) – Source: IBM/Telco Customer Churn (available on Kaggle). What it is: A fictional telecom customer dataset often used for churn modeling. It contains a variety of customer account data and whether they left (churned). Use Case: Great for hackathon demos of churn prediction or for calculating KPIs like churn rate, ARPU, service uptake, etc. Key Fields: Customer ID, tenure (months), services subscribed (phone, multiple lines, internet, streaming services, etc.), contract type (month-to-month, one-year, two-year), monthly charges, total charges, payment method, and a binary flag “Churn” indicating if the customer left in the last month. This dataset allows calculation of churn rate, ARPU (average of monthly charges), and exploration of factors influencing churn. (It’s small – ~7,000 customers – making it easy to experiment with in Snowflake or pandas.)
	•	Orange Telecom Churn Data – Source: Orange (a global telecom) via Kaggle. What it is: A large dataset (e.g. 50k+ rows) of customers with usage metrics and churn labels, often used in data science competitions. Use Case: More extensive churn analysis, segmentation, and even training ML models to predict churn. Key Fields: Typically includes call usage (number of calls, minutes used), data usage, customer tenure, charges, and churn label. Useful for feeding into a churn prediction pipeline or computing usage-based KPIs. (Being larger, it’s closer to real-world scale than the IBM sample.)
	•	Call Detail Records (CDR) Sample – Source: Open datasets or generators (e.g. a Kaggle CDR dataset) ￼. What it is: Call Detail Records are logs of phone calls/SMS with details like timestamp, duration, source/destination, cell tower, etc. Some public datasets provide anonymized CDRs (often for research). Use Case: Calculate network KPIs such as dropped call rate, average call duration, call volumes per hour, or even infer social network patterns. Also used in examples of CDR-based churn analysis (e.g. identifying if dropped calls correlate with churn) ￼. Key Fields: Caller ID, Callee ID (or at least tags like “on-net” vs “off-net”), call start time, call duration, end cause (normal vs dropped), cell tower or location code, call type (voice/SMS). Even a synthetic CDR dataset can enrich a demo by providing granular events to aggregate into KPIs like drop call rate per region per day.
	•	OpenCellID Cell Tower Database – Source: OpenCellID (Unwired Labs) ￼ ￼. What it is: The world’s largest open database of cell tower locations and identifiers. It aggregates crowdsourced data on cell towers (unique tower IDs with their latitude/longitude and radio details). Use Case: Map out network infrastructure, calculate coverage (e.g. visualize towers on a map or count how many towers each region has), or use as input for RF propagation modeling. Could also overlay with population to compute towers per 10k people as a network density KPI. Key Fields: Tower ID, radio type (GSM, UMTS, LTE, 5G), mobile country code & network code (MCC/MNC identifying operator), location (lat/long), and sometimes frequency info. The data is available by country and updated regularly (with an API for live data); it’s useful for any analysis requiring knowledge of network site locations.
	•	ITU World Telecom Indicators – Source: International Telecommunication Union (ITU) DataHub (free now) ￼. What it is: A collection of country-level telecom metrics collected from governments and operators worldwide. Includes historical data on number of mobile subscriptions, fixed telephone lines, broadband subscriptions, penetration rates, revenue, investment, etc. Use Case: High-level benchmarking and context – e.g., compare ARPU or penetration in the company’s markets vs global averages, track industry trends over time (mobile penetration growth, etc.). Key Fields: Metrics like mobile subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, percentage of individuals using the internet, fixed broadband subs per 100, telecom revenue as % of GDP, etc., by country/year. This can provide context KPIs (like market share if you know your subscriber base vs national subscriptions) and is handy for strategic dashboard indicators.
	•	Ofcom UK Telecom Statistics – Source: Ofcom (UK regulator) open data. What it is: Ofcom publishes datasets alongside reports (e.g. the Connected Nations report, which includes broadband coverage and mobile availability stats for the UK, and data on customer complaints by provider). Use Case: If focusing on a UK telco, this data can show industry benchmarks – e.g., average broadband speed, percent of UK premises with full-fiber, or how your customer complaint rate compares to industry average. Key Fields: For Connected Nations – number of premises passed by superfast or gigabit broadband, % of population with 4G/5G coverage from at least one operator, etc. For complaints data – complaints per 100k subscribers by provider and service. These public datasets allow a telco to gauge performance relative to competitors on key customer experience KPIs.

(Leveraging open datasets can jump-start the KPI dashboard – they provide realistic data for testing and can fill gaps if internal data isn’t readily available. Many of these (e.g. FCC, OpenCellID) can be loaded into Snowflake for analysis. Always check usage licenses: e.g., OpenCellID is CC-BY, the Kaggle data are generally open for analysis, and ITU DataHub data is free with attribution.)

4. Sample Telco KPI Data Schema

Finally, to organize the data for our telecom KPI dashboard, we propose a simple schema that captures the core information needed to calculate the above KPIs. This schema draws from common telecom data models ￼ and is tailored for analytical queries. It includes tables for customers, services, usage, network performance, etc., with suggested keys for joining:
	•	Customers – Contains one record per customer or subscriber. Columns: customer_id (PK), personal details (name, etc.), region_id (FK to Regions, indicating customer’s billing/service region), plan_id (FK to Plans, current subscribed plan), signup_date, and cancel_date (null if active). It may also include flags like is_active or attributes like contract_type and tenure (which can be derived from dates). Usage: Customer-level metrics (churn calculation uses cancel_date; ARPU can join to billing; region_id allows regional analysis). Join Keys: customer_id links to usage, calls, billing; plan_id links to Plans; region_id links to Regions.
	•	Plans – Defines the service plans or product offerings. Columns: plan_id (PK), plan_name (e.g. “Unlimited Premium”), plan_type (e.g. Mobile Postpaid, Fiber Broadband, Prepaid, etc.), monthly_fee, and key features (e.g. data_limit_gb, speed_tier, contract_term). Usage: ARPU can be informed by plan fees; plan_type can categorize revenue; linking plan to customers lets us group KPIs by plan (e.g. churn by plan type). Join Keys: plan_id is referenced by Customers (and possibly by usage records or subscriptions).
	•	Usage_Metrics – Fact table capturing aggregated usage by customer and period. For example, one row per customer per month. Columns: customer_id (FK to Customers), usage_date (could be month-end or day), voice_minutes, data_usage_gb, sms_count, etc. Could also include overage_charges or other monetized usage. Usage: Enables calculation of average usage per user, identification of heavy users, correlation of usage with churn (e.g. last-month-of-service usage), and computing KPIs like ARPU if revenue is usage-based (by joining with plan fees or overages). Join Keys: customer_id to Customers (hence to region and plan).
	•	Call_Records – This is a granular event table (CDR – Call Detail Records). Each row is one call or session. Columns: call_id (PK or composite of customer+timestamp), customer_id (caller or the subscriber who initiated/received if we only track our own subs), call_timestamp, call_duration_sec, call_type (voice, SMS, data session, etc.), termination_cause (normal, dropped, failed), and possibly cell_id or location info for the call. For data sessions, it could log session volume. Usage: From CDRs we compute network KPIs like drop call rate (termination_cause), average call duration, call volume trends, etc. It also can feed customer KPIs (e.g. total minutes used per customer if not in Usage_Metrics). Join Keys: customer_id to Customers; (cell_id to a Network Sites table if we add one).
	•	Network_Events – Captures network-level performance events or stats, which help compute KPIs like availability and congestion. Columns: event_id (PK), region_id (FK to Regions, or possibly a cell_id if very granular), event_date, event_type (e.g. “outage”, “maintenance”, “congestion alert”), duration (for outages), and impact (e.g. number of towers or customers affected). Alternatively, this table could be a daily Network_Stats table by region: e.g. one row per region per day with columns like uptime_hours, total_calls, dropped_calls, avg_latency_ms, packet_loss_pct, etc. Usage: Provides data to calculate Network Availability (e.g. sum of downtime from outages vs total time) and Dropped Call Rate (dropped_calls/total_calls) at various levels. If using a stats aggregate table, queries for network KPIs become simpler (select average packet_loss_pct by month, etc.). Join Keys: region_id to Regions (and indirectly to Customers, if we want to relate network stats to customer groups).
	•	Regions – A lookup table for geographic regions or market areas. Columns: region_id (PK), region_name (e.g. “Midwest US” or “London Metro”), maybe region_type (country, state, market). Could also hold hierarchies (e.g. region to a higher level). Usage: Allows slicing KPIs by region (churn in Region A vs B, network uptime by region). Join Keys: region_id links with Customers (customer’s home region) and Network_Events/Stats (where the network measurement was taken), enabling a join to analyze, say, churn vs network quality by region.
	•	Billing/Revenue – (Optional, could be derived from usage+plans) A table for financial data, e.g. monthly invoices or payments. Columns: billing_id, customer_id, billing_period, amount, revenue_type (service revenue vs device, etc.). Usage: To calculate ARPU directly from revenue data (sum revenue per period per user). Also useful for tracking unpaid bills (which could factor into churn). Join Keys: customer_id to Customers; possibly plan_id if breaking revenue by plan.
	•	Customer_Feedback – (Optional) A table for NPS/CSAT survey responses or support tickets. Columns: feedback_id, customer_id, date, feedback_type (“NPS” survey, “CSAT” after support call, or complaint ticket), score or rating, and maybe comments. Usage: Enables KPIs like NPS or average CSAT. Can also correlate a low NPS respondent’s later churn status. Join Keys: customer_id to Customers.
	•	Network_Sites – (Optional, if needed for tower-level analysis) Table of cell towers or network nodes. Columns: cell_id (PK), location (lat/long), region_id (to tie to region), technology (LTE, 5G, etc.). Usage: If we wanted to drill down KPIs by tower or do coverage maps. Join Keys: region_id to Regions; cell_id could link to Call_Records and Network_Events if those contain cell references.

This schema is purposely denormalized in places for simplicity (e.g. we attach plan_id to Customers directly, assuming one plan per customer at a time – in reality an account could have multiple lines/plans). It balances simplicity with the ability to compute KPIs:
	•	Churn Rate: from Customers by aggregating how many have cancel_date within a period vs. starting count (or using a separate fact table logging churn events).
	•	ARPU: from Billing or by joining Customers→Plans (using plan fees) and averaging, or summing revenue in Billing divided by count of customers.
	•	Network KPIs: from Network_Events/Stats (availability = 1 – downtime/total time, drop call rate = dropped_calls/total_calls, etc. as columns in that table).
	•	Usage KPIs: like average data per user from Usage_Metrics (sum data_gb / count users).
	•	Experience KPIs: NPS/CSAT from Customer_Feedback, and complaint rates possibly by joining support tickets in feedback.

All tables link via consistent keys (customer_id, plan_id, region_id), making it straightforward to join, say, customer churn data with their region and that region’s network stats, or to join plan info to usage to compute revenue. This schema can be implemented in Snowflake easily and scaled as needed (e.g. adding an Account table if modeling accounts vs individuals). It aligns with industry data models that include customer, network, and usage data as separate domains but connected for analysis ￼.
