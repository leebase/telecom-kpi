## ðŸ”¹ 4. Sample Schema Design

Based on comprehensive analysis of telecom data architectures and OSS/BSS systems, I've designed a normalized schema optimized for KPI calculation and real-time analytics[43][44][45][46].

### Core Entity Design

The schema follows a **star schema pattern** optimized for analytical queries while maintaining transactional integrity. The design incorporates industry-standard OSS/BSS separation with unified data access patterns for modern cloud architectures[44][47][48].

**Primary Fact Tables:**
- `usage_records`: Granular usage tracking for all services (voice, data, SMS)
- `call_records`: Call Detail Records (CDR) for voice service analysis
- `network_performance`: Real-time network metrics and KPI measurements
- `billing`: Monthly billing aggregations for revenue analysis

**Core Dimension Tables:**
- `customers`: Customer master data with demographics and account status
- `subscriptions`: Service subscriptions linking customers to plans and devices
- `plans`: Service plan catalog with pricing and feature definitions
- `network_elements`: Physical and logical network infrastructure inventory

### Table Relationships and Join Keys

**Customer Journey Schema:**
```sql
customers (customer_id) 
  â†“ 1:M
subscriptions (subscription_id, customer_id, plan_id, device_id)
  â†“ 1:M  
usage_records (usage_id, subscription_id)
call_records (cdr_id, subscription_id)
```

**Network Infrastructure Schema:**
```sql
network_elements (element_id)
  â†“ 1:M
network_performance (metric_id, element_id)
usage_records (usage_id, cell_tower_id â†’ element_id)
call_records (cdr_id, originating_cell â†’ element_id)
```

**Revenue and Billing Schema:**
```sql
customers (customer_id)
  â†“ 1:M
billing (bill_id, customer_id)
subscriptions (subscription_id, customer_id)
  â†“ 1:M
usage_records (usage_id, subscription_id)
```

### KPI-Optimized Field Design

**ARPU Calculation Fields:**
- `billing.total_amount`: Monthly revenue per customer
- `customers.status`: Active customer filter
- `billing.billing_period_start/end`: Time-based aggregation keys

**Churn Rate Calculation Fields:**
- `subscriptions.status`: Current subscription state
- `subscriptions.deactivation_date`: Churn event timestamp
- `subscriptions.activation_date`: Customer lifetime calculation

**Network Performance Fields:**
- `call_records.call_status`: Success/failure/drop classification
- `call_records.call_duration_seconds`: Service quality measurement
- `network_performance.metric_type`: Standardized KPI categorization
- `network_performance.threshold_min/max`: SLA compliance boundaries

### Scalability and Performance Considerations

**Partitioning Strategy:**
- **Time-based partitioning**: Usage and performance tables partitioned by month
- **Geographic partitioning**: Network elements partitioned by region
- **Customer segmentation**: Large customer tables partitioned by customer_type

**Indexing for KPI Queries:**
- **Composite indexes**: (customer_id, billing_period_start) for ARPU calculations
- **Time-series indexes**: (measurement_timestamp, element_id) for performance metrics
- **Status indexes**: (status, deactivation_date) for churn analysis

**Data Retention Policies:**
- **Real-time data**: 90 days for operational dashboards
- **Monthly aggregations**: 5 years for trend analysis
- **Annual summaries**: Permanent retention for regulatory compliance

This schema design supports both real-time operational dashboards and historical analytical queries while maintaining the flexibility to add new KPIs without structural changes. The normalized structure ensures data integrity while the star schema patterns optimize query performance for dashboard applications[43][49].

**Strategic Recommendations for Hackathon MVP:**

1. **Start with Core KPIs**: Focus on ARPU, Churn Rate, and Call Drop Rate as they provide immediate business value
2. **Leverage Free Data**: Begin with OpenCellID and FCC datasets for proof-of-concept development
3. **Plan for Snowflake**: Design data ingestion pipelines compatible with Snowflake's native connectors
4. **Emphasize Real-time**: Implement streaming data processing for network performance KPIs
5. **Design for Scale**: Use the provided schema as foundation for multi-tenant SaaS deployment

This research framework provides the essential foundation for building a telecom KPI dashboard that can attract business investment and demonstrate immediate value to telecom operators worldwide.
